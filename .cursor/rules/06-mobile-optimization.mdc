 # Mobile Optimization (Ionic Capacitor)

## Touch Controls
- Implement touch controls and gestures optimized for mobile devices
- Use responsive design techniques for UI elements
- Implement proper touch event handling and debouncing
- Consider multi-touch scenarios where appropriate

## Display Optimization
- Adapt the game UI for various screen sizes and orientations
- Use responsive design techniques for different device form factors
- Implement proper scaling for different pixel densities
- Handle notches and safe areas appropriately

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize asset quality and size for mobile devices
- Reduce load times and conserve bandwidth
- Implement efficient power management techniques
- Preserve battery life through optimized rendering
- Consider using the 'legacy:true' option for older mobile devices

## Native Features
- Utilize Capacitor plugins for accessing native device features
- Implement proper permissions handling
- Handle device-specific features gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for unsupported features
