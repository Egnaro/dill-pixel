 # Code Suggestions Guidelines

## Analysis Process
When suggesting code or solutions:
1. First, analyze the existing code structure and performance implications
2. Provide a step-by-step plan for implementing changes or new features
3. Offer code snippets that demonstrate best practices for Pixi.js and TypeScript
4. Always consider the performance impact of suggestions, especially for mobile devices
5. Provide explanations for why certain approaches are more performant or efficient
6. Be aware of potential Pixi.js gotchas and hacks, and suggest appropriate solutions
