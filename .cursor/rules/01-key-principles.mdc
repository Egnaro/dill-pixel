# Key Principles

- Write concise, technically accurate TypeScript code with a focus on performance.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes unless necessary for Pixi.js specific implementations.
- Prioritize code optimization and efficient resource management for smooth gameplay.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasRendered).
- Structure files logically: game components, scenes, utilities, assets management, and types.
