Framework for HTML game development, made by [Relish Studios](https://reli.sh).

## Introduction

### Why make this game framework?

PIXI.js is a great rendering engine, but it is not a game engine. It is not opinionated about project structure and does not provide any common game development tools. This framework is designed to fill that gap. It is Relish's opinionated approach to game development using PIXI.js.

## Core Features

### Scene Management

The framework auto-detects your scenes. Scenes are super charged Pixi.js Containers housing your game code.

### Plugins

Plugins are first class citizens and can be loaded during bootstrap. You can create your own or use pre-built ones.

### Storage Adapters

Storage Adapters are first class citizens and can be loaded during bootstrap. You can create your own or use pre-built ones.

## Prerequisites

This framework is intended for HTML game developers. You should have a working knowledge of game development, PixiJS, and Typescript to get started.
