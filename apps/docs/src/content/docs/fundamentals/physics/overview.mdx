Dill Pixel provides two physics plugins to suit different game development needs:

- **Snap Physics**: A lightweight, performance-focused 2D physics system ideal for platformers and simple collision-based games
- **Matter Physics**: A full-featured physics engine integration using Matter.js, suitable for complex physics simulations

## Choosing a Physics Plugin

### Snap Physics

Best for:

- Platformers and endless runners
- Games requiring basic collision detection
- Mobile-first games where performance is critical
- Simple projectile physics

### Matter Physics

Best for:

- Physics-based puzzle games
- Complex body interactions and constraints
- Realistic gravity and force simulations
- Games requiring advanced physics features

<Aside type="caution">
  Only one physics plugin should be active at a time in your game. While it's possible to use both, this isn't
  recommended due to performance implications and potential conflicts.
</Aside>

## Performance Considerations

- **Snap Physics** is more performant for simple collision detection and basic physics needs, making it ideal for mobile games
- **Matter Physics** provides more realistic physics but comes with additional overhead
- Both plugins support debug visualization, which should be disabled in production

<Aside type="tip">
  For mobile games or projects where performance is critical, start with Snap Physics and only switch to Matter Physics
  if you need its advanced features.
