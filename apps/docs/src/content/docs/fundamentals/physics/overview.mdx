Dill Pixel offers three physics plugins:

- **Snap Physics**: A lightweight, AABB and circle-based collision system inspired by Maddy Thorson's TowerFall physics
- **Crunch Physics**: A robust, grid-based physics system optimized for platformers and endless runners with advanced entity management
- **Matter Physics**: A full-featured physics engine (using Matter.js) for complex physics simulations

<Aside type="caution">Only use one physics plugin at a time to avoid performance issues and potential conflicts.</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  For performance-critical projects: - Use Snap Physics for simple platformers and basic collision detection - Use
  Crunch Physics for more complex games with many entities and advanced features - Use Matter Physics when you need
  realistic physics simulation
