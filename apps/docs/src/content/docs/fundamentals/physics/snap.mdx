import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Snap Physics Plugin provides a lightweight, deterministic physics system inspired by Maddy Thorson's TowerFall physics engine. It excels at platformer-style games requiring precise collision detection and resolution.

## Core Concepts

The system is built around three main entity types:

### Actors (`Actor`)

Dynamic entities that can move and collide with other objects. Actors:

- Handle their own movement and collision detection
- Can ride on moving platforms
- Support pass-through collision filtering
- Maintain sub-pixel movement precision

```ts
class Player extends Actor {
  update(deltaTime: number) {
    // Move with precise collision detection
    this.moveX(velocity.x * deltaTime);
    this.moveY(velocity.y * deltaTime);
  }
}
```

### Solids (`Solid`)

Static or kinematic objects that block movement. Solids:

- Can move and push actors
- Support one-way platforms
- Handle riding actors automatically
- Can be static or kinematic

```ts
class Platform extends Solid {
  move(x: number, y: number) {
    // Automatically pushes riding actors
    this.move(x, y);
  }
}
```

### Sensors (`Sensor`)

Trigger areas that detect but don't block movement. Sensors:

- Detect overlapping entities
- Don't affect movement
- Support filtering by entity type
- Useful for triggers and detection zones

```ts
class TriggerZone extends Sensor {
  passThroughTypes = ['Actor', 'Player']; // Entities that won't trigger
  update() {
    // Check all overlapping entities
    this.activeCollisions = this.resolveAllCollisions();
  }
}
```

## Collision Resolution

### Basic Resolution

By default, collisions stop movement and prevent overlap. However, you can customize this behavior by implementing a collision resolver:

```ts
// src/scenes/MyPhysicsScene.ts
import { Scene } from 'dill-pixel';
import SnapPhysicsPlugin from '@dill-pixel/plugin-snap-physics';

export class MyPhysicsScene extends Scene {
  get physics() {
    return this.app.getPlugin('snap-physics') as SnapPhysicsPlugin;
  }

  async initialize() {
    // ... other initialization code
    this.physics.system.initialize({
      // ... other options
      collisionResolver: this._resolveCollision,
    });
  }

  private _resolveCollision(collision: Collision) {
    // Implement your custom collision resolution logic here
    switch (collision.type) {
      case 'Player|Enemy':
        handlePlayerEnemyCollision(collision);
        return false; // Don't block movement
      case 'Player|Coin':
        collectCoin(collision);
        return false; // Pass through
      default:
        return true; // Block movement (default behavior)
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Resolution

The collision resolver receives detailed information about each collision:

```ts
type Collision = {
  entity1: Entity; // First colliding entity
  entity2: Entity; // Second colliding entity
  type: string; // Combined type (e.g. "Player|Platform")
  direction: string; // Collision direction
  overlap: {
    // Overlap amounts
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  // Additional collision data
};
```

### Riding & Pass-Through

The system supports advanced features like:

- **Riding** - Actors can ride moving platforms
- **Pass-Through** - One-way platforms and selective collision filtering
- **Pushing** - Solids can push actors out of the way when moving

```typescript
// Example of configuring pass-through types
class Player extends Actor {
  passThroughTypes = ['OneWayPlatform'];
}
```

### Common Resolution Patterns

1. **One-Way Platforms**:

```ts
// Example of a one-way platform`
private _resolveCollision(collision: Collision): boolean {
  if (collision.type === 'Player|Platform') {
    const platform = collision.entity2 as Platform;
    if (platform.oneWay) {
      // Only collide when coming from above
      return collision.direction === 'bottom';
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

2. **Trigger Areas**:

```ts
class TriggerZone extends Sensor {
  private _onPlayerEnter() {
    // Handle player entering trigger zone
  }

  update() {
    // Check for collisions without blocking
    const collisions = this.resolveAllCollisions();
    if (collisions) {
      collisions.forEach((collision) => {
        if (collision.entity2.type === 'Player') {
          this._onPlayerEnter();
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Moving Platforms**:

```ts
class MovingPlatform extends Solid {
  move(dx: number, dy: number) {
    // First move the platform
    this.position.set(this.x + dx, this.y + dy);
    // Then push any riding actors
    this.getAllRiding().forEach((actor) => {
      actor.move(dx, dy);
    });
  }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  The collision resolver is called for every collision before it's resolved. Returning `true` will block movement and
  push objects apart, while `false` allows objects to pass through each other.

## Spatial Partitioning

For better performance with many objects, the system uses a spatial hash grid:

```typescript
// Configure in your scene
this.physics.system.initialize({
  useSpatialHashGrid: true,
  gridCellSize: 200, // Adjust based on average object size
});
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Larger grid cells mean fewer cells to check but more objects per cell. Smaller cells mean more precise collision
  checks but more overhead. Choose a size that balances performance with your game's needs.
