In Dill Pixel, a Scene is a container that contains a game's assets, logic, and UI. For example, a simple game might have `Title`, `Game`, and `GameOver` scenes.
Let's see how we would include those in our game and switch between them.

## Creating a Base Scene

To create a new scene, create a new file in the `src/scenes` directory. For example, let's create a `BaseScene`
that all of our other game scenes will extend. This first scene should extend dill pixel's [`Scene`](/api/classes/scene) class
and for now we'll just add custom `enter` and `exit` methods that will fade all of our scenes in and out:

<Code code={baseSceneTs} lang="ts" title="src/scenes/BaseScene.ts" />

## Creating a Scene

Next, let's create a `StartScene` that extends our `BaseScene`:

<Code code={startSceneTs} lang="ts" title="src/scenes/StartScene.ts" />

## Configuring Scenes

Scenes in the ./src/scenes directory will be automatically registered with the game.

You can configure how your scene is loaded by modifying a few custom exports in your scene file:

```ts
export const id = 'game'; // the scene's id. If not provided, the file name will be used
export const dynamic = false; // if true, the scene will be loaded dynamically
export const active = false; // if true, the scene will be active in the scene list

export const debug = {
  label: 'Game', // the scene's label. If not provided, the id will be used
  group: 'Game', // the scene's group in the debug panel (optional)
};
```

## Switching Between Scenes

To switch between scenes, use the `loadScene` method on the app:

```ts
// From within the Application.ts file
this.loadScene('game'); // reference by the scene's id

// From outside of the Applicatiqon.ts file, and not within a scene,
// you can call the app's loadScene method directly
app.exec.loadScene('game'); // reference by the scene's id

// From within a scene (or any container with an Application instance)
this.app.exec.loadScene('game');
```
