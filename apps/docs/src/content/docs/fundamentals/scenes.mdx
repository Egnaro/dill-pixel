In Dill Pixel, a Scene is a container that contains a game's assets, logic, and UI. For example, a simple game might have `Title`, `Game`, and `GameOver` scenes.
Let's see how we would include those in our game and switch between them.

## Creating a Base Scene

To create a new scene, create a new file in the `src/scenes` directory. For example, let's create a `BaseScene`
that all of our other game scenes will extend. This first scene should extend dill pixel's [`Scene`](/api/classes/scene) class
and for now we'll just add custom `enter` and `exit` methods that will fade all of our scenes in and out:

<Code code={baseSceneTs} lang="ts" title="src/scenes/BaseScene.ts" />

## Creating a Scene

Next, let's create a `StartScene` that extends our `BaseScene`:

<Code code={startSceneTs} lang="ts" title="src/scenes/Start.ts" />

## Configuring Scenes

Scenes in the ./src/scenes directory will be automatically registered with the game.

You can configure how your scene is loaded by modifying a few custom exports in your scene file:

```ts
export const id = 'game'; // the scene's id. If not provided, the file name will be used
export const dynamic = false; // if true, the scene will be loaded dynamically
export const active = false; // if true, the scene will be active in the scene list

export const debug = {
  label: 'Game', // the scene's label. If not provided, the id will be used
  group: 'Game', // the scene's group in the debug panel (optional)
};
```

### Strongly-typing Scene exports

To get autocompletion and type-checking for your scene exports, you can use the helper types exported from `dill-pixel`. This is especially useful for `assets` and `plugins` where you can get autocompletion for bundle names and plugin IDs.

Here's how you can type your exports:

<Code
  code={`import type { SceneAssets, ScenePlugins, SceneDebug } from 'dill-pixel';

export const id = 'my-scene';

// will autocomplete with object properties and available bundle names
export const assets: SceneAssets = {
    preload: {
      bundles: ['game'],
    },
    autoUnload: true,
};

// will autocomplete with available plugin ids
export const plugins: ScenePlugins = ['my-plugin']; 

// will autocomplete with debug object properties
export const debug: SceneDebug = {
    group: 'My Game',
    label: 'My Awesome Scene',
};`}
  lang="ts"
  title="src/scenes/MyScene.ts"
/>

<Aside>
  You can also use the `SceneConfig` type to type all exports at once, but typing them individually is often cleaner.
  <Code
    code={`import type { SceneConfig } from 'dill-pixel';

export const assets: SceneConfig['assets'] = { /* ... */ };
export const plugins: SceneConfig['plugins'] = [ /* ... */ ];
export const debug: SceneConfig['debug'] = { /* ... */ };`}
    lang="ts"
  />
</Aside>

## Switching Between Scenes

To switch between scenes, use the `loadScene` method on the app:

```ts
// From within the Application.ts file
this.loadScene('game'); // reference by the scene's id

// From outside of the Applicatiqon.ts file, and not within a scene,
// you can call the app's loadScene method directly
app.exec.loadScene('game'); // reference by the scene's id

// From within a scene (or any container with an Application instance)
this.app.exec.loadScene('game');
```
