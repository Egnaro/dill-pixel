dill pixel uses a simple state management system to manage the different states (or screens)
in your game. For example, a simple game might have a `TitleScreen`, `GameScreen`, and `GameOverScreen`.
Let's see how we would include those in our game and switch between them.

## Creating a Base Scene

To create a new scene, create a new file in the `src/scenes` directory. For example, let's create a `BaseScene`
that all of our other game scenes will extend. This first scene should extend dill pixel's [`Scene`](/api/classes/scene) class
and for now we'll just add custom `animateIn` and `animateOut` methods that will fade all of our scenes in and out:

<Code code={baseSceneTs} lang="ts" title="src/scenes/BaseScene.ts" />

## Creating a Screen

Next, let's create a `StartScene` that extends our `BaseScene`:

<Code code={startSceneTs} lang="ts" title="src/scenes/StartScene.ts" />

## Registering Scenes

Scenes in the ./src/scenes directory will be automatically registered with the game.
You can configure how your scene is loaded by modifying a few custom exports in your scene file.

<Code code={applicationTs} lang="ts" title="src/MyApplication.ts" />

## Switching Between Scenes

To switch between scenes, use the `transitionTo` method on the game instance:

```ts
// From within the Application.ts file
this.loadScene('game'); // reference by the scene's id

// From outside of the Application.ts file, and not within a scene,
// you can call the app's loadScene method directly
app.loadScene('game'); // reference by the scene's id

// From within a scene (or any container with an Application instance)
this.app.loadScene('game');
```
