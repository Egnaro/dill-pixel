dill pixel supports the [Spine format](https://esotericsoftware.com/) for animations.
Spine is a 2D skeletal animation tool that allows you to animate 2D characters and objects
in a way that is similar to how 3D animations are done. This allows for more complex
animations and more efficient use of resources.

## Getting Started

To work with Spine in dill pixel you'll need to enable dill pixel's Spine plugin in your game's configuration via the `useSpine` property.

```ts
// dill-pixel.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'dill-pixel';

export const config = defineConfig({
  ...
  useSpine: true,
  ...
});

```

## Loading a Spine Animation

### 1. Include your spine animation in your assets:

Ensure your spine animation is included in your assets folder and you've [configured your application's assets for assetpack](/guides/project-setup), (example below):

<FileTree>
- assets
  - spine\{m\}
    - spineboy-pro.skel
    - spineboy-pro.atlas
    - spineboy-pro.png
</FileTree>

### 2. Add the spine animation to your scene:

```ts
// import the SpineAnimation class from dill pixel
import { SpineAnimation, Scene } from 'dill-pixel';

// ensure your scene loads the spine assets
export const assets = {
  preload: {
    bundles: ['spine'],
  },
};

export default class SpineScene extends Scene {
  // declare the spine animation variable
  private _spine: SpineAnimation;

  public async initialize() {
    // add the spine animation to your scene
    this._spine = this.add.spineAnimation({
      data: 'spine/spineboy-pro.skel',
      animationName: 'idle',
      loop: true,
    });
  }
}
```

## Playing an Animation

To play an animation on the spine object, call `.setAnimation` with the animation name, and whether the animation should loop or not:

<Aside type="tip">
  The third parameter, `trackIndex`, is optional and defaults to 0. Track indices allow you to play multiple animations
  simultaneously on different tracks, enabling animation mixing and layering.
</Aside>

### Example:

```ts
// Play an animation
this._spine.setAnimation('walk', true);

// or play an animation on a specific track
// the track index is optional and defaults to 0 (fine for most cases)
// this._spine.setAnimation('walk', true, 1);
```

<Aside type="tip">You can pause and resume spine animations using the `paused` property:</Aside>

### Example:

```ts
// Pause the animation
this._spine.paused = true;
// Resume the animation
this._spine.paused = false;
```
