title: Application
---

The Application class is the entry point for your game. It is responsible for initializing the game, loading assets, and managing the game loop.

import { Aside, Code, TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import indexHtml from '../../../project-files/index.html?raw';
import indexCss from '../../../project-files/src/css/style.css?raw';

The [Application](/api/classes/application) class is the entry point for your game. It is responsible for initializing the game, loading assets, and managing the game loop. It extends PIXI's Application class and implements core functionality through plugins and signals.

## Creating an Application

Creating an application is now a fully automated process. The framework handles the bootstrapping for you, so you can focus on your game's configuration and logic.

### Configuration

You configure your application in the `dill-pixel.config.ts` file. This is where you'll define core settings, plugins, and, importantly, specify your custom application class.

```ts
// dill-pixel.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'dill-pixel';
import { MyApplication } from './MyApplication';

export default defineConfig({
  // Point to your custom Application class
  application: MyApplication,

  // Core settings
  id: 'MyGame',
  resizeToContainer: true,
  resolution: 2,

  // Plugin configurations
  plugins: [
    ['matter-physics', { autoLoad: false }],
    // ... other plugins
  ],

  // ... other configurations
});
```

### Bootstrapping

The entire bootstrapping process is handled by a single import in your `src/index.ts` file. This special import dynamically loads the framework and starts your application based on your config file.

```ts
// src/index.ts
import('dill-pixel-runtime');
```

This will automatically:

1. Find your `dill-pixel.config.ts` file.
2. Instantiate the `application` class you specified in the config.
3. Initialize the application with your configuration.
4. Look for an optional `src/main.ts` and execute its default export.

### Application Logic Entry Point (Optional)

For any logic that needs to run immediately after the application is created, you can create a `src/main.ts` file. The framework will automatically execute the default export of this file, passing the created `app` instance to it.

```ts
// src/main.ts
import type { MyApplication } from './MyApplication';

export default function main(app: MyApplication) {
  // This code runs right after the app is created.
  console.log('My application is ready!', app);
  // you can access the application instance via `app`
  // if you need to do something specific after the application is created, you can do it here.
}
```

If you don't need any post-initialization logic, or if you prefer to handle it within your `Application` class's `setup` method, you can simply omit the `src/main.ts` file.

## Core Features

### Signals

The Application provides core signals (defined in [ICoreSignals](/api/interfaces/icoresignals)) for various built-in signals. These signals are used to communicate between different parts of the application, and can be accessed via `this.app.signals` or `this.app.signal`. These signals are usually aliases for plugins that provide the functionality. E.G. `this.app.signals.onSceneChangeStart` is just an alias for the SceneManagerPlugin's `onSceneChangeStart` signal - `this.app.scenes.onSceneChangeStart.connect((detail) => { ... })`:

```ts
// Listen for scene changes
this.app.signals.onSceneChangeStart.connect((detail) => {
  console.log(`Changing from ${detail.exiting} to ${detail.entering}`);
});

// Listen for window resizing
this.app.signals.onResize.connect((size) => {
  console.log(`Window resized to ${size.width}x${size.height}`);
});
```

### Core Functions

Similarly, the Application provides core functions (defined in [ICoreFunctions](/api/interfaces/icorefunctions)) for common operations. These functions are used to perform various actions, and can be accessed via `this.app.exec` or `this.app.func`. These functions are usually just aliases for the plugins that provide the functionality. E.G. `app.exec.loadScene('gameScene')` is just an alias for the SceneManagerPlugin's `loadScene` function - `this.app.scenes.loadScene('gameScene')`.

```ts
// Scene management
app.scenes.loadScene('game');
// also available as `app.exec.loadScene('game')`

// Popup management
app.popups.showPopup('menuPopup');
// also available as `app.exec.loadScene('game')`
```

## Using `this.app` in Containers and Scenes

Both [Container](/api/classes/container) and [Scene](/api/classes/scene) classes provide access to the Application instance via `this.app`. This gives you easy access to all Application features:

```ts
export class MyScene extends Scene {
  initialize() {
    // Access core functions
    this.app.assets.loadBundles('required');

    // Listen to signals
    this.app.onResize.connect(this.handleResize);

    // Access plugins
    this.app.audio.play('background-music');

    // Manage data
    this.app.data.save('score', 100);
  }
}
```

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example showing how to create a custom Application with the new streamlined process:

<Tabs>
   <TabItem label="dill-pixel.config.ts">
```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'dill-pixel';
import { MyApplication } from './MyApplication';

export default defineConfig({
    id: 'MyApplication',
    application: MyApplication, // Specify your custom application class
    // ... other config ...
});
    ```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="index.html">
        <Code lang="html" code={indexHtml}/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="index.css">
        <Code lang="css" code={indexCss}/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="src/index.ts">
        ```ts
        // That's it! This one line handles everything.
        import('dill-pixel-runtime');
        ```
    </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="src/MyApplication.ts">
    ```ts
    import { Application } from 'dill-pixel';

    export class MyApplication extends Application {
        setup() {
          // This method is called automatically by the framework.
          console.log('MyApplication setup complete!');
        }

        public doSomethingCustom() {
          console.log('Doing something special!');
        }
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="src/main.ts">
    ```ts
    // main.ts is optional, but if you need to do something after the application is created, you can do it here.

    import type { MyApplication } from '@/MyApplication';

    export default async function main(app: MyApplication) {
      console.log('main.ts executed!');
      await app.doSomethingCustom();
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="src/scenes/Game.ts">
    ```ts
    import { Scene } from 'dill-pixel';
    import type { MyApplication } from '@/MyApplication';

    export default class Game extends Scene {
      initialize() {
        // You get full intellisense for your custom application class
        this.app.doSomethingCustom();
      }
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
