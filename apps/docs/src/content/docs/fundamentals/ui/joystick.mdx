title: Joystick
---

Dill Pixel includes a built-in virtual joystick component that provides touch-based directional input for games. The Joystick class is based on the pixi-virtual-joystick library but has been ported to TypeScript and adapted specifically for Dill Pixel.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of creating a joystick:

```ts
const joystick = new Joystick({
  // Optional custom textures
  inner: this.make.sprite({
    asset: 'joystick/handle',
    sheet: 'ui',
  }),
  outer: this.make.sprite({
    asset: 'joystick/base',
    sheet: 'ui',
  }),
  innerScale: 0.7,
  outerScale: 0.7,
});
```

The joystick provides:

- Directional input (up, down, left, right and diagonals)
- Power/intensity value based on distance from center
- Angle information in degrees
- Touch/pointer event handling
- Customizable appearance
- Threshold setting to control dead zone

While the joystick comes with a default skin (simple black circles), you can easily customize its appearance by providing your own textures for the outer base and inner handle through the constructor options.

### Using the Joystick with the Actions Plugin

To use the joystick with the action system, you need to:

1. Register it with touch controls:

```ts
this.app.controls.touch.joystick = joystick;
```

2. Map joystick directions to actions in your config:

```ts
const controls = defineControls(actions, buttons, {
  touch: {
    joystick: {
      move_left: ['left', 'bottom_left', 'top_left'],
      move_right: ['right', 'bottom_right', 'top_right'],
    },
  },
});
```

You can see examples of the joystick implementation in the physics demo scenes:
