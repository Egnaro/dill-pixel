The splash screen is the first thing a user sees when your game loads. You can create a custom splash screen to show loading progress or display your branding.

## Custom Splash Screen

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>
        Create a `Splash.ts` file in the `src/scenes` folder. This will be displayed when the game starts. Similar to a Scene,
        there are `initialize()`, `added()`, `enter()` and `exit()` methods to control how the screen is revealed and hidden. It also contains a `update()` method that runs every tick, and a `handleLoadProgress()` method that can be used to update the progress of the loading screen. For
        simplicity's sake we're just creating a green background and adding a title that can be clicked to take us to
        the next screen:
        <Code code={splashTs} lang="ts" title="src/Splash.ts" />
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      In `./dill-pixel-config.ts`, import your `Splash` class:

      ```ts
      import Splash from '@/Splash';
      ```

      and set the set the `splash` property to
      ```json
      { ... // other config
        splash: {
          view: Splash
        }
    	...
      }
      ```

      your `dill-pixel.config.ts` should now look like this:
      <Code code={dillPixelConfigTs} lang="ts" title="dill-pixel.config.ts" />
    </li>
    <li>
      in `index.html`, you can remove the `loader.css` import, as we're no longer using it.
    </li>

  </ol>
</Steps>
