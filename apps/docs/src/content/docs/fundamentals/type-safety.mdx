title: Automatic Type-Safety
---

import { Aside, Code, TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Dill Pixel is designed to provide a highly productive and type-safe development experience out of the box. The framework automatically generates TypeScript definition files based on your project's configuration and assets, giving you powerful IntelliSense and preventing common runtime errors.

This happens in two key areas: Application-level types and Asset-level types.

<Aside>
  This entire process is handled automatically by the Vite plugins included in the framework. You don't need to
  configure anything to enable it.

## Application Types

The framework inspects your `dill-pixel.config.ts` and `src/scenes` directory to understand the structure of your application. It then generates a `src/types/dill-pixel-app.d.ts` file that uses TypeScript's [module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) to override core framework types.

This provides you with autocompletion for:

- Scene IDs
- Action names and contexts
- Plugin and Storage Adapter IDs
- Your custom `Application` class methods and properties.

### Scene Transitions

When you define scenes in `src/scenes`, their IDs are automatically added to the `AppScenes` type. This means you get full autocompletion when loading or transitioning to a scene.

```ts
// Assuming you have a scene in `src/scenes/MainMenu.ts`
// with `export const id = 'main-menu';`

// ✅ Correct: You'll get 'main-menu' in your IntelliSense list.
this.app.scenes.loadScene('main-menu');

// ❌ Incorrect: TypeScript will flag this as an error.
this.app.scenes.loadScene('non-existent-scene');
```

### Actions and Contexts

Actions and contexts defined in your `dill-pixel.config.ts` are used to generate `AppActions` and `AppContexts` types.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="dill-pixel.config.ts">
```ts
export const contexts = defineContexts(['game', 'menu']);

export const actions = defineActions(contexts, {
  jump: { context: ['game'] },
  open_menu: { context: '*' },
});
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="game.ts">
```ts
// From within a Container or Scene

// ✅ Correct: 'jump' and 'open_menu' will be suggested.
this.app.sendAction('jump');

// ✅ Correct: The context 'game' will be suggested.
this.app.actionContext = 'game';

// ✅ Correct: The context 'menu' will be suggested.
this.app.actionContext = 'menu';

// ❌ Incorrect: TypeScript will throw an error.
this.app.sendAction('invalid-action');

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom Application Class

When you specify a custom `application` class in your config, the framework ensures that `this.app` is correctly typed to your class everywhere, giving you access to any custom methods you've added.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="MyApplication.ts">
```ts
import { Application } from 'dill-pixel';

export class MyApplication extends Application {
  public saveGame() {
    console.log('Game saved!');
  }
}
````

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SomeScene.ts">
```ts
import { Scene } from 'dill-pixel';
export default class SomeScene extends Scene{
  async start() {
    // ✅ Correct: `saveGame` is available on `this.app`, so you get autocompletion.
    await this.app.saveGame();
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Asset Types

Similarly, the framework watches your asset manifest (typically `public/assets/assets.json`) and generates a `src/types/dill-pixel-assets.d.ts` file. This file contains types for all your asset aliases.

This gives you autocompletion when loading, retrieving, and using assets like textures, audio, and spritesheets.

### Loading and Retrieving Assets

All asset aliases from your manifest are available for type-safe loading and retrieval.


### Using Textures and Audio

The types flow through the entire framework, providing safety and autocompletion when using assets with other components.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Using a Texture">
```ts
// From within a Container or Scene

// ✅ Correct: You get autocompletion for texture aliases here.
const player = this.add.sprite({asset: 'player-sprite'});
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Playing Audio">
```ts
// From within a Container or Scene

// ✅ Correct: You get autocompletion for audio aliases.
this.app.audio.play('background-music');
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Using Spritesheet Frames">
```ts
// From within a Container or Scene

// If you have a spritesheet packed with TexturePacker,
// the frame names are also typed.
// ✅ Correct: 'character/walk_01' is a known frame name.
const spriteFromTPS = this.add.sprite({ texture: 'character/walk_01' });
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
