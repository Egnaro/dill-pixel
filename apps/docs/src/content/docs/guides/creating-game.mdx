In the [Quick Start guide](./quick-start), we learned how to set up a very simple project using dill pixel.
Now let's go through the process of creating a basic game.

## Custom Splash Screen

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>
        Create a `Splash.ts` file in the `src` folder. This will be displayed when the game starts. Similar to a Scene,
        there are `added()`, `enter()` and `exit()` methods to control how the screen is revealed and hidden. It also contains a `update()` method that runs every tick, and a `handleLoadProgress()` method that can be used to update the progress of the loading screen. For
        simplicity's sake we're just creating a green background and adding a title that can be clicked to take us to
        the next screen:
        <Code code={splashTs} lang="ts" title="src/Splash.ts" />
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      In `./dill-pixel-config.ts`, import your `Splash` class:

      ```ts
      import Splash from '@/Splash';
      ```

      and set the set the `splash` property to
      ```json
      { ... // other config
        splash: {
          view: Splash
        }
    	...
      }
      ```

      your `dill-pixel.config.ts` should now look like this:
      <Code code={dillPixelConfigTs} lang="ts" title="dill-pixel.config.ts" />
    </li>
    <li>
      in `index.html`, you can remove the `loader.css` import, as we're no longer using it.
    </li>

  </ol>
</Steps>

## Create Scenes

### Game Scene

Create a `Game.ts` file in the `scenes` folder. This will be the main game scene with a few
elements: an image, a title, a message, and a button.

Add the id and debug label to the scene

```ts
export const id = 'game';
export const debug = {
  label: 'Game',
};
```

Clicking on the image will trigger a short animation and increment a counter. Clicking the
button will take us back to `StartScene`.

Note that in the `destroy()` method we're cleaning up the `gsap` animations.

<Code code={gameSceneTs} lang="ts" title="src/scenes/Game.ts" />
