Dill Pixel provides a command-line interface (CLI) to get you up and running with a new project in seconds. This is the recommended way to start.

## Quick Start with the CLI

To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal. This will scaffold a new Vite-powered project with all the necessary files and configurations.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		```bash
		npm create dill-pixel@latest
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		```bash
		yarn create dill-pixel
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		```bash
		pnpm create dill-pixel
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The CLI will prompt you for a project name and set up a new directory with a default template.

## Project Structure

The generated project contains a few key files for you to work with:

- **/index.html**: The main entry point for the browser. You typically won't need to edit this.
- **/dill-pixel.config.ts**: The heart of your application's configuration. This is where you define plugins, assets, scenes, and more.
- **/src/index.ts**: The TypeScript entry point. Its only job is to start the framework.
- **/src/main.ts** `(Optional)`: An optional file for running logic right after the application has been created.
- **/src/scenes/**: Place your game scenes in this directory. They will be automatically discovered by the framework.
- **/public/assets/**: Place your game assets here.

<Aside>
All the complex Vite and TypeScript configuration is handled for you by the `@dill-pixel/framework`. You don't need a `vite.config.js` in your project root unless you need to add other Vite plugins or deeply customize the build.

### Bootstrapping Your Game

The entire startup process is handled by a single line in `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import('dill-pixel-runtime');
```

This tells the framework to:
1. Load your `dill-pixel.config.ts`.
2. Create the application instance you defined in the config.
3. Initialize all plugins and systems.
4. Optionally, run your `src/main.ts` file.

This streamlined process lets you focus on building your game, not on bundler configuration.

## Start the dev server

		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label={"pnpm"}>
		```bash
		pnpm run dev
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Build for production

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label={"npm"}>
		```bash
