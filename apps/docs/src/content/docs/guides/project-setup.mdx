## Organizing Files and Directories

A new project scaffolded with `create-dill-pixel` will have the following structure. This is the recommended setup for organizing your files.

<FileTree>
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- dill-pixel.config.ts
- index.html
- **public**
    - **assets**
        - **audio\{m\}**
            - music
            - sfx
        - **game-assets\{tps\}**
            - obstacle.png
            - rocket.png
- **src**
  - index.ts
  - main.ts (optional)
  - MyApplication.ts
  - **scenes**
    - BaseScene.ts
    - StartScene.ts
  - **utils**
    - Constants.ts
  - **locales**
    - en.ts
  - **css**
    - style.css
</FileTree>

- **dill-pixel.config.ts**: The main configuration file for your game.
- **public/assets/**: The directory for all your game assets. This is watched by the asset pack system.
- **src/index.ts**: The single entry point that boots the framework.
- **src/MyApplication.ts**: Your optional custom `Application` class.
- **src/scenes/**: The directory where all your game scenes live.

## Vite Configuration

<Aside>
The framework handles all the necessary Vite configuration internally. You do not need a `vite.config.mjs` file in your project's root unless you have a specific need to add custom Vite plugins or override the default build process.
</Aside>

Dill Pixel uses Vite to compile your game for both development and production. The default Vite configuration is imported automatically from the `dill-pixel` package and is optimized for web game development, including features like:

-   Top-level `await` support.
-   WASM integration.
-   Automatic asset bundling and type generation.
-   Globals for scenes, plugins, and adapters.
